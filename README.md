# Detect Changes on Website
This program loads a page periodically and checks if there are any changes to it compared to the given value.
It can do this by hashing the site, or if that is not possible, by checking a specific element using Pythons webscraper: BeautifulSoup 

To package this program so it can run as a lambda, follow this tutorial.
